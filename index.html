        <p><strong>Once upon a time</strong> there was a little swan who felt so very <i>strange</i>... You see, for as long as the swan could remember, it had wanted to be a goose!
            <br>The little swan would gander at the gaggles or geese grazing and swallow sad swan tears.. "someday", it said..
        
        <p>Today you can make this little swan's dreams come true! <b>Please</b> - click to transform it into its <i>true form</i>!</p>

        <p><small>*Note: once transformed please do not keep clicking - it only wants to be a goose..</small></p>
