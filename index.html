        <h1>The Little Swan that Goosed!</h1>
        <h3>A Website by Swan the Goose</h3> 
        <p>Once upon a time there was a little swan who felt so very strange...
            
            You see, for as long as the swan could remember it had wanted to be a goose! The little swan would gander at the gaggles or geese grazing and swallow its sad swan tears.
        
        <p>Today you can make this little swan's dreams come true! Please! Click on to transform it into its true form!</p>

        <p>*Note: once transformed please do not keep clicking - it wishes to remain a goose..</p>
