            <br>The little swan would gander at the gaggles or geese grazing and swallow sad swan tears.. "someday", it said..
        
        <p>Today you can make this little swan's dreams come true! Please - click to transform it into its <i>true form</i>!</p>

        <p><small>*Note: once transformed <b><i>please</i></b> do not keep clicking - it only wants to be a goose..</small></p>
