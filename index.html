        <h1>The Little Swan that Goosed!</h1>
        <h3>A Website by Larswan the Goose</h3> 
        <p>Once upon a time there was a little swan who felt so very strange... For as long as it could remember the swan had wanted to be a goose!
            Each fall, wading in the creek with the rest of its family the swan would gander in awe as a distant V pierced through the sky. It heard the trumpets of a hundred geese honk by on their yearly treck southward to greener pastures.
        
            <!--<hr>-->
        <p>Today you can make this little swan's dreams come true! Wave your magic mouse over it to transform it into a beautiful goose!</p>
