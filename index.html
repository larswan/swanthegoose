            <p><strong>Once upon a time</strong> there was a little swan who felt so very <i>strange</i>... You see, for as long as the swan could remember, it had wanted to be a goose!
                <br>The little swan would gander at the gaggles or geese grazing and swallow sad swan tears.. "someday", it said..
            
            <p>Today you can make this little swan's dreams come true! Click to transform it into its <i>true form</i>!</p>

            <p><small>*Note: once transformed <b><i>please</i></b> do not keep clicking - it only wants to be a goose..</small></p>
